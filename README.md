# Trust (aka Wufi)
-> A next-gen p2p reputation system (and possibly currency platform)

### The general goal: 
  
  * to allow users to contextually rate the actions of other users, on or offline, by boosting/nixing a user's "social capital" (for now, let's call these "wallet" and "pocket" balances)
  * to allow users to see any other user's centrality and general or contextual "social capital" from their own perspective on the network (for now, let's call these metrics Wufi scores)
  * to allow users to use their Wufi Power to spend/earn a currency onto anyone, even complete strangers (for now, let's call it Wufi)

### Stated, inherent features:

  * collusion-resistant: you cannot receive Wufi for stuff from users you have not directly or indirectly boosted/nixed, so making false accounts will not increase your Wufi Score
  * sybil attack-resistant: boosting any user's Wufi Power only gives that user a higher proportion of your total boosted amount (unlike Facebook 'likes' or Twitter 'retweets' and other spammable voting systems); this means giving a user trillions of Wufi only devalues the social capital of everyone else you have previously boosted
  * self-promotion and slander-resistant: creating fake identities only increases/decreases your real account's Wufi score from the spam account's perspective; if these spam accounts are never boosted/nixed by real users, then the spam account's perspective provides no value to any other real user
  * ????: while your reputation within a context may be negative, the worst Wufi Score you can have is 0

### Future (desired) plans/features:

  * 
  * Incorporation with some federated social networking platform (probably pump.io or Trsst) for public sharing of boosts/nixs and contextual hashtags
  * 

###### Some terms: (* = yet to be finalized)

  * boosting* : the action of raising a user's Wufi Power (increasing their "wallet" and your "pocket"
  * nixing*: the action of lowering a user's Wufi Power (decreasing their "wallet" and your "pocket"
  * wallet*: the amount of Wufi a user can spend (without drawing on their pocket balance)
  * pocket*: the amount of Wufi a user has boosted

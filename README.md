# Trust (aka Wufi)
-> A p2p social cryptocurrency network

### The general goal: 
  
  * to allow users to rate the actions and content of other users, on or offline, by gifting or nixing a user's Wufi Score
  * to allow users to see any other user's general or contextual Wufi Score from their own perspective on the network
  * to allow users to spend and earn Wufi from anyone, even complete strangers, with no single or centralized issuer

### Stated, inherent features:

  * collusion-resistant: you cannot receive Wufi for stuff from users you have not directly or indirectly boosted/nixed, so making false accounts will not increase your Wufi Score
  * sybil attack-resistant: boosting any user's Wufi Power only gives that user a higher proportion of your total boosted amount (unlike Facebook 'likes' or Twitter 'retweets' and other spammable voting systems); this means giving a user trillions of Wufi only devalues the social capital of everyone else you have previously boosted
  * self-promotion and slander-resistant: creating fake identities only increases/decreases your real account's Wufi score from the spam account's perspective; if these spam accounts are never boosted/nixed by real users, then the spam account's perspective provides no influence to any other real user
  * ????: while your reputation within a context may be negative, the worst total  Wufi Score you can have is 0

### Future (desired) plans/features:

  * 
  * Incorporation with some p2p or federated social networking platform (probably twister, or pump.io or Trsst) for public sharing of gifts, nixes, payments and contextual hashtags
  * 

###### Some terms: (* = yet to be finalized)

  * nixing*: the action of lowering a user's Wufi Score (decreasing their "wallet" and your "pocket" balances)

# Trust (aka Wufi)
=> An experimental p2p, reputation (crypto)currency

### The general goals: 
  
  * users can rate the actions and content of other users, on or offline, by sharing or nixing Wufi with a user
  * users can then see any other user's rep from their own perspective in the network
  * users can spend and earn Wufi through connections made by sharing Wufi

### Stated, inherent features:

  * collusion-resistant: you cannot receive Wufi for stuff from users you have not directly or indirectly boosted/nixed, so making false accounts will not increase your Wufi Score
  * sybil attack-resistant: boosting any user's Wufi Power only gives that user a higher proportion of your total boosted amount (unlike Facebook 'likes' or Twitter 'retweets' and other spammable voting systems); this means giving a user trillions of Wufi only devalues the social capital of everyone else you have previously boosted
  * self-promotion and slander-resistant: creating fake identities only increases/decreases your real account's Wufi score from the spam account's perspective; if these spam accounts are never boosted/nixed by real users, then the spam account's perspective provides no influence to any other real user
  * ????: while your reputation within a context may be negative, the worst total  Wufi Score you can have is 0

### Future (desired) plans/features:

  * 
  * Incorporation with some p2p or federated social networking platform (probably twister, or pump.io or Trsst) for public sharing of gifts, nixes, payments and contextual hashtags
  * 

###### Some terms: (* = yet to be finalized)

  * sharing* : raises a user's rep, increasing their wallet and your pocket balances
  * nixing*: lowers a user's rep, decreasing their wallet and your pocket balances
  * wallet*: the amount of Wufi a user can spend without drawing on their pocket balance
  * pocket*: the net total amount of Wufi a user has shared and nixed


###### new temporarily-placed musings:

  * sharing raises your rep == more whuffie to spend in more of the network
  * nixing lowers your rep == less whuffie to spend in less of the network

    unlike cash, where there is a single issuer and so the game is to acquire as much as possible, everyone can create whuffie, so the game is about getting as much as possible from as much of the network as possible


  * access vs ownership
  * tipping a user gives them more whuffie to spend in more places/more of the network
